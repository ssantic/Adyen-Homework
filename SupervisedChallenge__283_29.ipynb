    "# Adyen Data Science Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "An important application of data science at Adyen is to protect our merchants from fraudulent transactions. Fraudulent transactions happen when a fraudster steals a legit customer's credit card, and uses it to unlawfully buy goods online. For this reason, Adyen has a risk system in place that can refuse a transaction if it is suspected to be fraudulent. The overall goal is to reject as much fraud as possible, without compromising legit customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adyen knows that a transaction was fraudulent when it receives a chargeback. A chargeback is a notification from the card network that the amount of the transaction must be refunded to the legit customer. A chargeback can only happen on approved payments (i.e. if it was refused by our risk system or by the bank, money doesn't get deducted from the legit customer's account, thus no chargebacks can happen).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, your goal is to train a model to predict which transaction might be fraudulent and improve Adyen's risk system. What is important for our merchants is that the chargeback rate should at all time stay below 1%, while keeping revenue as high as possible. A chargeback costs them 15 EUR, +50% of the price of the goods (in the form of lost goods that they sent to the fraudster). While declining a transaction that turned out to be non-fraudulent (false positive) also costs them 50% of the price of the goods (in the form of missed revenue).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset provided you'll find 30 days of payment data for a few merchants, a merchant is a client for which we process payments, e.g. an e-commerce website, different merchants are not necessarly different companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Field | Explanation|\n",
    "|:-----:| :------------------ |\n",
    "| merchant | The id of our client |\n",
    "| first_6_digit | The first 6 digit of the credit card used in the transaction which was recieved by our client |\n",
    "| payment_ref | The unique reference for this payment |\n",
    "| amount_eur | The amount in euros |\n",
    "| card_network | The network that emitted the card (shown as SchemeX, where X is variable)|\n",
    "| card_type | The type of card (debit,credit...)|\n",
    "| timestamp | The timestamp when this specific payment was received |\n",
    "| device_info | Information about the device used to perform the payment |\n",
    "| risk_checks | A list of lists, each sub-list contains a weight in first position and a rule (ID) in the second. The weight (which we call a risk score) which is assigned to each rule is directly proportional to the likelihood of the payment being fraudulent (negative: unlikely to be fraudulent, zero: check is performed but not seen as important, above zero: more likely to be fraudulent).  Merchants can create custom rules to flag some payments as fraudulent. The weight can also be assigned manually. Not all possible checks might be triggered by a payment (eg. a check might be relevant only for one country) so not all the possible checks are always present in the list, in other words, not all checks are the same for each datarow.|\n",
    "| refused_by_adyen_risk | Some of the risk-checks (rules) can force a payment to be refused; a refuse can also be caused by a predefined threshold on the risk-checks, such that if the score of the different rules exceed the threshold, the payment can be refused.|\n",
    "| refused_by_bank | A payment can also be refused by the bank for various reasons (lack of funds, card lost etc..)|\n",
    "| bank_country_id | The country ID of the bank |\n",
    "| user_id | The id of the user that is performing the payment, this can be used to identify users performing multiple payments. Usually a fraudulent payment is enough to identify the user as fraudster, this means that all of their payments can be considered fraudulent.   |\n",
    "| user_country_id | The country of the user that is performing the payment |\n",
    "| autorised_times | An array that contains up to 50 timestamps of the most recent accepted payments of this user on our platform. If there are no previously known approved payments of this user on our platform the array is empty. |\n",
    "| received_dates | An array that contains up to 50 timestamps of the most recent previously requested payments, populated only if the user has requested other payments on our platform before.|\n",
    "| billing_address_dates | An array which contains the timestamps when a payment request with a different billing address was received, an empty list means we never receveived a request with a different address.\n",
    "| delivery_address_dates | An array that will contain the timestamps when a payment request with a different delivery address was received, an empty list means we never receveived a request with a different delivery address.|\n",
    "| ip_dates | An array that will contain the timestamps when a payment request with a different ip address, compared to the first payment, was received; an empty list means we never receveived a request with a different address. This list can be seen as a set.|\n",
    "| is_fraud | Wether the payment was flagged as fraudulent. This happens when we receive a notification from the bank and can only happen for payments that were not already refused by adyen or by the bank.|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim of the Challenge \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this challenge is to understand how you approach both a new problem as a new dataset. In order to understand this process please include markdown cells in which you discuss your choices with regards to the data preparation and model choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "You can start working right in this Jupyter Notebook, save the results and send to submit it. The data which you will need is provided in different formats (csv, json, parquet), feel free to choose the one that is most convienent for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "(We will optionally accept submission in any other language/format as long as it comes with the full code and there is a clear explanation on how to execute it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also there are bonus points if you can make your model into a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We kindly ask to submit your results within 48 hours since receiving this challenge.\n"

Training and testing a model on the same data can lead to overfitting, as we can't be sure how the model will generalize, i.e. perform on new, unseen data. This is why we split our original dataset into a trainining dataset, used for building a model, and a testing dataset, used for testing the model's performance on new data. Ratio's of 80:20 and 70:30 are common, and here we'll go with 70:30, due to the small number of cases. We'll also set the seed for the random number generator, in order to ensure reproducibility. Finally, we'll opt for stratified sampling, in order to ensure that the distribution of classes in both datasets is as close as possible."

    "As we've seen from the numbers, we're facing a significant class imbalance. Just training a model on the dataset as it is will produce good results on the majority class, but terrible results on the positive class (fraud, in our case). The tricky part here is that looking at just the overall accuracy will show great results - but this is deceiving. For class imbalance problems, it's important to look at alternative model metrics, such as Recall, F1 Score (the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall), and the Area under the ROC Curce (AUC).\n",

Using different levels of balancing the training dataset during resampling: so far, for upsampling and downsampling we've made sure that the ratio of positive to negative classes is 1:1, but this doesn't have to be so. We can uses various ratios for these two methos, and different values of k for SMOTE.\n",
